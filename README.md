# streaming-05-smart-smoker
This project implements a data producer for streaming sensor data from a smart smoker system. The sensor data is stored in a CSV file, and the producer reads this data and sends it to RabbitMQ queues. The data includes temperature readings for the smoker itself and two food items (Food A and Food B), with readings taken every 30 seconds.

## Getting Started


 
Before running the producer, ensure the following requirements are met:

- RabbitMQ server is running.
- The `pika` library is installed in your active Python environment.

## The key features of this project include:

- Reading sensor data from the CSV file.
- Sending data to RabbitMQ queues with specified queue names.
- Simulating sensor data streaming at a rate of one value every 30 seconds.
- Opening the RabbitMQ Admin website for queue monitoring.


## How to Use

**To use the producer, follow these steps:**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure RabbitMQ is running.
3. Install the `pika` library if not already installed (`pip install pika`).
4. Execute the `bbq_producer.py` script.
5. Open the RabbitMQ Admin website for queue monitoring.
6. The producer will start sending sensor data to the specified queues.
